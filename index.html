      <h1>What is Git?</h1>
      <p> Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a
        series of snapshots (commits) of your code base. WIth the creation
        of each snapshot you build out a whole applicaiton, seeing the
        growth of a full app. During this time you can make branches to
        experiment and come back to a previous snapshots you took or merge
        those experiments into your app.
      </p>
      <h1> What is Github?</h1>
      <p> Github is a code hosting platform for version control and
        collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from
        anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during development.
      </p>

<!--MAIN CONTENT, broken down into three rows-->
    <div id="mainContent">

      <div id="topRow">
        <div class="box" id="box1">
          <p>Git init</p>
          <p><span class="highlight"> Git init</span> is the act of
            registering this current code base.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="box2">
          <p>Git add</p>
          <p><span class="highlight"> Git add</span> is how we stage the
            intergration of our current code base into our current
            list of snapshots
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="box3">
          <p>Git status</p>
          <p><span class="highlight"> Git status</span> allows us to see
            the changes we are going to make
          </p>

     </div>

      <div id="middleRow">
        <div class="box" id="box4">
          <p>Git commit</p>
          <p><span class="highlight"> Git commit</span> finally we can commit
            those changes we added to our last snapshot giving us a new snapshot
             of our code with whatever new changes were made
           </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="box5">
          <p>Git remote add</p>
          <p><span class="highlight"> Git remote add</span> is used to set up
            an online repository where we can place all of our current code.
            This is where the outside world can see our code base.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div id="bottomRow">
        <div class="box" id="box6">
          <p>Git push</p>
          <p><span class="highlight"> Git push</span> is how we get our code to
             Gitbuh, an excellent place to store all of our repositories.
             Other developers might look at our exisitng projects to see how
             we approached problems, pull down our code and add new features or
              even update our code base with features or even update our code
              base with features they wanted to add
          </p>
